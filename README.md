## Description

CRWN Clothing is a project I initiated to gain hands-on experience in setting up, maintaining, and implementing best practices for an e-commerce website. Through this project, I delved into advanced concepts in React and various related technologies. The website offers users the ability to register or log in, maintain a persistent shopping cart, navigate different product categories (hats, jackets, etc.), select and modify items in the cart, and complete the checkout process using a credit card.

To ensure a robust and scalable application, the site was initially built using Redux, followed by the implementation of Redux Thunk and Redux Saga for additional practice. I adhered to industry-standard architecture practices and meticulously maintained code formatting throughout the project. The styling was initially done using CSS, and later refactored using Styled Components for a more streamlined development experience.

CRWN Clothing showcases reactivity and responsiveness, providing an intuitive user experience. The website leverages the power of Firebase to maintain a userbase and facilitate secure authentication. Additionally, React Router is employed to enable seamless navigation between different routes.

With CRWN Clothing, I aimed to broaden my skills in e-commerce development, React, and related technologies. Explore the codebase to witness the culmination of my learnings and dedication to building a high-quality, feature-rich e-commerce site.

## Technologies
* [React](https://react.dev/) - Front-end library.
* [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Client side app routing.
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - State management.
* [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Redux development toolkit.
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Database management.
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Consistent style management.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Site deployment.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - Credit card payment management.

## Challenges
* State management - redoing the application in Thunk and Saga.
* Styled components - learning a new styling framework.

## Future Implementation
* Use/redesign codebase to use as a tested template for local vendors.
* Redesign UI to be less minimalistic.

## User Story
```md
AS AN e-commerce clothing customer
I WANT to have an easy-to-navigate store with secure payment portals
SO THAT I can buy stylish clothing with peace of mind.
```

## Installation
* Clone directory to code editor of choice
